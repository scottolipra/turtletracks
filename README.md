This code is nothing I stand proud of.  But I'm trying.  Really trying, to learn Ruby.

I wanted to do this with TDD, but I couldn't get the first test to pass.. simply requiring a blank .rb file.  Wasted 40 minutes on that.  Almost said, "forget this whole thing."  But I pressed on without doing R-Spec.  

I look forward to seeing better ways of doing all that I'm doing.  The way this is turning out for me is C++ esuqe , or maybe JS.  Not very Ruby.  But, that's how I think right now.  I sure hope someone can help me steer straighter.
